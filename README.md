## Guidelines for Contributors

Welcome to the PR2 GitHub repo!

All contributions are welcome; however, please keep these things in mind when contributing:
- Only edit things if you know exactly what they do and what you're doing.
- If you want to edit something but don't exactly know what to do, post an issue and someone will assist you.
- When submitting a pull request, leave a summary of your changes in the title/description.
- I'll check all of the code before it goes in, but make sure it won't throw a syntax error by checking it [here](https://phpcodechecker.com/).
- Do not post an issue on the repo for things that are not issues with the code.
- Do not submit malicious pull requests.

To submit new ideas, post a thread in the [PR2 Suggestions](https://jiggmin2.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?fid=45) section on [the JV2 forums](https://jiggmin2.com/forums). To appeal PR2 bans, post a thread in the [Ask a Mod](https://jiggmin2.com/aam) section.
